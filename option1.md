# Configuring Outcome Mapping Option #1

> **"Thresholds Based on Point Totals"**

?> :white_check_mark: Based on final point total of entire assignment/quiz

Option #1 is the easiest to configure for an assignment because it uses the **full final point total** of an entire assignment to be applied to a single Pathways outcome. Faculty decide the point total thresholds that meet the three Pathways levels: Developing Competency, Competent, and Advanced Competency.

## Selecting an Assignment

The select assignment page displays a list of assignments that are valid for Option #1.  If an assignment is available it will have a green **"Select"** button to its right. :one:  If it has already been configured for another outcome, the button will be greyed out and marked as **"Unavailable"**. :two:

If you have more than ten (10) assignments eligible, then the assignments will be broken into multiple pages that can be scrolled through at the bottom of the list. :three:

Clicking the name of an assignment will open that Canvas assignment in a new browser tab. :four:

In the list, you are reminded of the points that each assignment is worth :five: and the state of the assignment in Canvas: published (available to students), unpublished (unavailable to students), or already configured for another outcome. :six:

## Configure Competency Threshold

Once an assignment is selected under Option #1, you are able to set the threshold scores for the three Pathways levels that are based on the final point total of the assignment. :one:

The sliders reflect the total points, and will always move in concert with one another to guarantee that all three levels always are accounted for.  Minimums are *inclusive* of the number shown.  The left slider :two: sets the minimum score for **Competent**.  The right slider :three: sets the minimum score for **Advanced Competency**.  The three levels are then indicated by the bar below. :four:

The sliders are, by default, set to approximately 70% of the total points for Competent and 90% of the total points for Advanced Competency.  Move the sliders to the desired values for each level.

When you are satisfied with the levels, click the **Confirm and Save** :five: button.  You will receive a confirmation pop-up box. :six: Click anywhere on the screen to return to the Dashboard page.

## Finalizing Option #1

!> ***IMPORTANT NOTE***  
Your assignment must already have been completed by students, **AND** you must grade the assignment before continuing.

From the Dashboard screen, click the **Finalize Outcomes** button next to the assignment configured with Option #1.

![Begin finalizing option 1](/_media/finalizeoption1.png "Begin finalizing option 1")

The Pathways tool will automatically read the grades for your assignment and apply the threshold levels set previously.

Double-check both that your threshold levels are set correctly and that the distribution of scores matches your perception of the quality of student work submitted. If students have not completed the assignment or you have not graded those students' assignments, they will be categorized under "No Evidence".

If the data are correct, click the **Confirm & Submit** button then click anywhere on the screen to return to the dashboard.

The assignment will then appear as **Complete**.  If you have completed this process too soon (e.g., more assignments need to be graded, accidentally clicked Confirm, etc.), click the **Undo Finalization** button.
