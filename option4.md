# Configuring Outcome Mapping Option #4

> **"Use an Existing Grading Rubric"**

?> :white_check_mark: Use point totals for selected rubric items to apply a Pathways rating for an outcome  
:white_check_mark: Can use the same assignment for multiple Pathways outcomes  
:white_check_mark: Outcomes will be visible to students if you use Pathways-specific rubric items

Option #4 allows you use a Canvas rubric in an assignment and use the grading of those items to set Pathways ratings.  You may optionally add Pathways-specific items to a rubric.

> Students *will* see the Pathways-specific rubric outcomes when they view the details of your grading. If you do not want this, consider using [Option #5](option5.md) instead.

## Setting up a Rubric

!> The details of using rubrics in Canvas is beyond the scope of this document. Please review TLOS's and Instructure's documentation for [adding and grading with rubrics](https://4help.vt.edu/sp?id=kb_article&sys_id=c3f4df0a875fced0dd17426acebb35c7#UseRubrics).

## Adding Pathways-Specific Outcomes to a Rubric (optional)

You may optionally add Pathways-specific outcomes to your rubric, if your either existing rubric items don't adequate address Pathways outcomes or you wish to use a rubric only for Pathways ratings.

!> This ***MUST*** be done prior to selecting and configuring Option #4 as described below.

In a rubric, click the **Find Outcome** link at the bottom of the rubric.

![Find rubric link](/_media/findrubric.png "Find rubric link")

In the "Find Outcomes" pop-up, select **Pathways Assessment** and then the Pathways concept under which your desired outcome is located. 

![Rubric outcome selection step 1](/_media/rubricoutcome1.png "Rubric outcome selection step 1")

Select the outcome from the list.  Uncheck the box for "Use this criterion for scoring".  Click the **Import** button.  Repeat this process for each outcome that can be evaluated in this assignment.

![Rubric outcome selection step 2](/_media/rubricoutcome2.png "Rubric outcome selection step 2")

When grading using SpeedGrader, ensure that you choose one of the Pathways levels in the rubric for each student.

## Selecting an Assignment

The select assignment page displays a list of assignments that are valid for Option #4.  If an assignment is available it will have a green **"Select"** button to its right. :one:

If you have more than ten (10) assignments eligible, then the assignments will be broken into multiple pages that can be scrolled through at the bottom of the list. :two:

Clicking the name of an assignment will open that Canvas assignment in a new browser tab. :three:

In the list, you are reminded of the points that each assignment is worth :four: and the state of the assignment in Canvas: published (available to students), unpublished (unavailable to students), or already configured for another outcome. :five:

If you are using [Pathways-specific rubric items](#adding-pathways-specific-outcomes-to-a-rubric-optional), to help you match an assignment to the outcome you're currently working on, the list of assignments also displays a list of Pathways outcomes that have been already been added to an assignment's rubric. :six: If there are no Pathways-specific outcomes associated with the assignment you want to use, you can click on the name of the assignment to add them now. You may only select one assignment per Pathways learning outcome.

If one assignment addresses multiple Pathways learning outcomes, Option #4 allows the same assignment to be used to measure more than one Pathways outcome.

## Configure a Rubric for Rating

You will see a list of your assignment's rubric items ***similar*** to the following image:

![Option 4 Rubric Item List](/_media/option4selectingitems.png "Option 4 Rubric Item List")

In this example, there are five questions in this quiz.  Click the checkbox next to each question that you would like to include in the rating for the currently selected Pathways outcome :one:.

!> ***IMPORTANT NOTES***  
:eight_pointed_black_star: The rubric must be configured ***in your assignment*** as "Use this rubric for assignment grading" for it to be available for use here.  
:eight_pointed_black_star: The total of the rubric items you select should ***at least*** be three (3) points to allow proper distribution of the three Pathways rating levels.

![Use Rubric for Grading](/_media/userubricforgrading.png "Use Rubric for Grading")

Once rubric items are selected, you are able to set the threshold scores for the three Pathways levels that are based on the total points of the selected items.

The sliders reflect the total points, and will always move in concert with one another to guarantee that all three levels always are accounted for.  Minimums are *inclusive* of the number shown.  The left slider :two: sets the minimum score for **Competent**.  The right slider :three: sets the minimum score for **Advanced Competency**.  The three levels are then indicated by the bar below.

Click the **Confirm and Save** button :four: then click anywhere on the screen when the confirmation box appears.

## Finalizing Option #4

!> ***IMPORTANT NOTE***  
Your assignment must already have been completed by students, **AND** you must grade the assignment before continuing.

From the Dashboard screen, click the **Finalize Outcomes** button next to the assignment configured with Option #4.

![Begin finalizing option 4](/_media/finalizeoption4new.png "Begin finalizing option 4")

You will see a review of the rubric items you selected and the thresholds you set during configuration.

![Option 4 Setup Review](/_media/option4review.png "Option 4 Setup Review")

Double-check that the distribution of scores matches your perceptions of the quality of student work submitted. If students have not completed the assignment or you have not graded those students' assignments, they will be categorized under "No Evidence".

![Confirming option 4 setup](/_media/confirmoption3.png "Confirming option 4 setup")

If the data are correct, click the **Confirm & Submit** button then click anywhere on the screen to return to the dashboard.

The assignment will then appear as **Complete**.  If you have completed this process too soon (e.g., more assignments need to be graded, accidentally clicked Confirm, etc.), click the **Undo Finalization** button.
