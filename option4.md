# Configuring Outcome Mapping Option #4

> **"Hiding Assessment from Students for a Single Pathways Outcome"**

?> :white_check_mark: Students won't see ratings for Pathways Outcomes in the gradebook.  
:white_check_mark: With this method, the same assignment can be used to assess multiple Pathways Outcomes.  
:white_check_mark: Requires separate grading in a specialized tool. Course grading and Pathways assessment are separate processes.  

Option #4 allows you to assess multiple Pathways outcomes using the same assignment while hiding the Pathways ratings from students.

Once all students have submitted their assignments, you can begin assessment in the Pathways tool using a specialized grading interface that allows you to assign ratings to students. Only twenty (20) students must be rated; however, it is encouraged that you assess as many as you can.

## Selecting an Assignment

The select assignment page displays a list of assignments that are valid for Option #4.  If an assignment is available it will have a green **"Select"** button to its right. :one:  If it has already been configured for another outcome under Option #1 ("Thresholds Based on Point Totals"), the button will be greyed out and marked as **Unavailable**. :two:

If you have more than ten (10) assignments eligible, then the assignments will be broken into multiple pages that can be scrolled through at the bottom of the list. :three:

Clicking the name of an assignment will open that Canvas assignment in a new browser tab. :four:

In the list, you are reminded of the points that each assignment is worth :five: and the state of the assignment in Canvas: published (available to students), unpublished (unavailable to students), or already configured for another outcome. :six:

## Confirming the Configuration

Once an assignment has been selected, you will receive a message confirming that Option #4 will create a copy to be assessed.

Click the **Confirm and Save** button then click anywhere on the screen when the confirmation box appears.

## Initiating Rating Assessment

!> ***IMPORTANT NOTE***  
Your assignment must already have been completed by students.

In the Dashboard, the status bubble will now be updated to reflect that further action is necessary. To begin assigning Pathways ratings, click the **Initiate Assessment** button to its right.

## Generating a Sample of Students

Option #4 requires you to apply Pathways ratings to either a minimum of twenty (20) students or to your entire roster if you have fewer than twenty students. If you have more than twenty students, it is ***encouraged*** for you to rate as many students as possible and practical so that Pathways has a richer set of data.

In the first step after initiating assessment, you will see a list of the sections in your Canvas course.  If you have only one section, you can choose the "Select all sections" option. If you have multiple sections, you should only select those sections that are being assessed for Pathways this semester.

When the correct sections have been selected, click the **Generate Sample** button.

## Rating Submissions

Once a random sample of up to twenty (20) students has been generated, you'll be presented with a list of the **required students** followed by a list of the **optional students**. In the sample course below, there are only twelve students in the course, so **ALL** are required to be rated.

For each student, you will see a set of four buttons that correspond to the possible Pathways ratings. :one: Clicking a rating button changes the background color to match the button's color and a border will appear to further denote your selection. Clicking the same button a second time will unset that choice. As you click buttons, your choices are saved automatically.

To view each student's submission to the assignment, click each student's "Submission Link" :two:, and it will open in a separate browser tab.

When you select a Pathways rating for a student, a green check will appear next to the student's row. :three: Students without a rating will have a circle with a line through it. :four:

As you rate students, a counter will remind you of the number of required ratings you have completed. :five:

When all required students have been rated, click the **Complete Competency Assessment** button. That button will be disabled until all required students have been rated. At any time, you can click the **Save for Later** button and continue assessment at a later time. :six:

Regardless of your choice, you will receive a confirmation pop-up box. Click anywhere on the screen to return to the Dashboard page.

## Continuing Saved Assessment

If you have saved your assessment for later, you can resume assessment by clicking the **Continue Assessment** button on the Dashboard page.

![Continue Assessment](/_media/continueassessment.png "Continue Assessment")

## Revisiting Assessment

If you need to make changes to your assessment or accidentally confirmed, you can click the three-dot button and choose **Revisit Assessment** on the Dashboard page next to the outcome in question.

## Finalizing Option #4

Once you have completed all required ratings and have clicked the **Complete Competency Assessment** button, the Dashboard will allow you to finalize this outcome. Click the **Finalize Outcomes** button to its right.

![Finalize Option 4](/_media/finalizeoption4.png "Finalize Option 4")

Double-check that the distribution of scores matches your perceptions of the quality of student work submitted. If students have not completed the assignment or you have not graded those students' assignments, they will be categorized under "No Evidence".

![Confirming option 4 distribution](/_media/confirmoption4.png "Confirming option 4 distribution")

If the data are correct, click the **Confirm & Submit** button then click anywhere on the screen to return to the dashboard.

The assignment will then appear as **Complete**.  If you have completed this process too soon (e.g., more assignments need to be graded, accidentally clicked Confirm, etc.), click the **Undo Finalization** button.
