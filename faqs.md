# Frequently Asked Questions

## Assessing Non-Canvas Assignments
### What do I do if I am assessing assignments not submitted electronically in Canvas (e.g., physical papers, performances, in-class discussions, in-class activities)?

To use the Pathways Assessment Tool, an assignment **must** exist in your Canvas course; however, it can be set up so the assignment is still __administered__ outside of Canvas.

Add your assignments under "Assignments" in Canvas. Under "Submission Type" select either "No Submission" or "On Paper". You must publish the assignment in order to apply grades. These assignments can then be assigned to Pathways outcomes in the tool.

If you are not assigning grades to this student work, you can still select it for Pathways assessment. Add the assignment as described above and leave the assignment as **unpublished**.  Students will not see it in their gradebook.  In the Pathways Assessment Tool, choose **Option #4** when linking the assignment to an outcome. Use the rating tool described on the [Option #4](option4.md) page to assign Pathways ratings to students.

## Third-Party Software
### How can I use student work that utilizes third-party software such as ALEKS, Cengage, MyLab, etc.? 

If you use LTIs (third-party software or tools linked from Canvas) for assignments, quizzes, or any other graded material, you can use [Option #1](option1.md) to assess an assignment if it:

1. Exists in Canvas under "Assignments"
2. Its grade appears in Canvas under "Grades"
3. The assignment completely addresses one and only one of the Pathways outcomes in your course.

If you use an LTI for assignments or quizzes that address multiple Pathways outcomes, there is no direct way to connect an outcome to an LTI assignment or quiz through the tool.  In this case, you have two options:

1. Choose alternate assignments or quizzes to evaluate for Pathways
2. Create "No Submission" or "On Paper" assignments in Canvas that you will need to grade separately

## Hiding Pathways Ratings
### What if I don’t want my students to see how they are rated on the Pathways student learning outcomes approved for my course?

Options #1, #2, and #4 all effectively hide Pathways evaluation from students.

To determine Pathways rating levels:
- Option #1 uses final scores on assignments
- Option #2 uses performance on quiz questions
- Option #4 creates a copy of an assignment's responses and grades them on a rubric unavailable to students

## Separating Ratings from Grades
### How can I make sure that student ratings on Pathways student learning outcomes are not part of students’ course grades?

Options #1 and #2 rely on existing grading to determine Pathways rating levels. If you're using Option #1 and only want to use it for Pathways assessment &mdash; not grading &mdash; then be sure to check the box for "Do not count this assignment towards the final grade" when editing the assignment.

For Option #3, follow the [instructions for setting up a rubric](option3.md#setting-up-a-rubric) for Pathways assessment.

For Option #4, the assignment created by the copy automatically will not be included in final grades.

## Classic vs. New Quizzes
### I currently use Classic Quizzes but would like to use Option #2 for Pathways assessment. Should I make the switch to New Quizzes? If so, what do I need to do?

Due to how Canvas classic quizzes work, they cannot be used for Option #2 of the Pathways Assessment Tool.  Classic quizzes *can* be used for Option #1 if the entire quiz addresses one and only one Pathways outcome.

If you want to switch to New Quizzes, review the information on the [Option #2](option2.md) page regarding how New Quizzes are different from classic quizzes as well as how to create and configure a New Quiz for Pathways.

## Option #4 Assignments
### If I want to use Option #4, what type of assignments can I use?

The copy feature used in Option #4 **ONLY** works for regular assignments in Canvas.  It does **NOT** work for quizzes or discussion posts.

We are actively working on a solution that allows Option #4 to work more broadly for hiding Pathways assessment from students.

## Rating Late Work
### What if I have already graded/rated student work for Pathways assessment and then a student submits late work?

Pathways ratings are not locked into the Pathways Assessment Tool until the "Finalization" step is completed for each outcome. As long as an outcome has not been finalized, you can grade late student work, and it will still be included when the outcome is finalized.

If you have already finalized an outcome, you can click the **Undo Finalization** button next to a Pathways outcome in the tool dashboard, and then finalize again after grading is complete.

## Sampled for 1 of Many Sections
### What if I am teaching multiple sections of the same course this semester but only one section has been sampled for Pathways assessment?

If each section is loaded into Canvas as a separate course, then you will only need to configure the Pathways Assessment Tool for that section's Canvas course.

If you have a single Canvas course with multiple sections in it, you should configure the course in the Pathways Assessment Tool as discussed throughout this guide.  If you're using Option #3 or #4, then you'll only need to apply Pathways ratings to those students in the assessed section.

## Large, Multi-Section Course Setup
### If I am the course coordinator for a large, multi-section Pathways course, can I configure the Pathways Assessment Tool for the sampled sections taught by my GAs so that they can just do the grading/rating? How do I do this?

If you have full access to edit the course as would the instructor, you are able to configure the tool as a proxy for the instructors.  Simply walk through the steps in this guide to do so for the various Pathways options.

## Cross-Listed Courses
### I am planning to cross-list my course but haven't done it yet. Can I configure the Pathways Assessment Tool now?

If you are planning to cross-list your course, you should ***first*** ensure that all cross-listing is completed in Banner and Canvas. Only then should you configure the Pathways Assessment Tool in the primary course. Configuration does not transfer to cross-listed courses due to the way Canvas stores information about assignments.
