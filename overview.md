## Pathways Tool Home Page

The Pathways Tool home page is where you can monitor your progress through *configuring* and *completing* assignments for Pathways assessment.  Only the Pathways learning outcomes that apply to your course will be listed :one:, and only those outcomes can be configured through the tool.

> ### Configuring
>
> Configuring means applying an assignment or quiz to a Pathways outcome

> ### Completing
>
> Also called "Finalizing" in the tool, completing means that you have already graded your assignment and that you are ready to confirm the distribution of student scores across the three Pathways assessment levels

There are two meters that show your progress through the Pathways assessment process.  The first indicates how many of the outcomes in your course have an assignment applied :two:.  The second indicates how many configured outcomes have been completed and are ready for final reporting :three:.  Both buttons by the meters will take you to the same dashboard page.

When all assignments have been configured and completed, the **Review Outcomes & Submit** button :four: will take you to the final step of the Pathways assessment process: submitting your report.

If you have any problems or questions about the Pathways assessment process or the Pathways tool, the box at the top of the page :five: has important email addresses and a link to the 4Help system where you can submit a help ticket. 

!> *The example image has names and email addresses redacted*.

Clicking the home button :six: at the very top of the page will return you to the Pathways Tool home page from anywhere in the tool.

## Pathways Tool Dashboard

The tool dashboard page redisplays the Pathways learning outcomes that apply to your course :one: with options to begin configuring assignments to them.

In the list, there are three columns to note.  First, once an assignment is configured, it will be listed with a link that takes you directly to the assignment in your Canvas course :two:.  

Second, a bubble will indicate the current status of each Pathways outcome :three:. Rolling your mouse pointer over the question mark icon next to the bubble will explain the status message, or if you scroll to the bottom of the page, there is a full legend for the four possible statuses :four:.

The third column displays a button that allows you to take the next possible action for that Pathways outcome :five:.  Once an outcome has been configured, a three-dot button will appear :six: that will allow you to clear an incorrect configuration.

As on the home page, a help box contains email addresses and a link to the 4Help system :seven:.

!> *The example image has names and email addresses redacted*.

Additionally, the **Dashboard** link at the top of the page :eight: will return you to this page from anywhere in the tool.

## Choose Assignment Page

The first step in the Pathways assessment process is to select an assignment that will be used to assess a particular learning outcome.  The Choose Assignment page is reached by clicking the **Choose Assignment** button in the third column of an outcome on the Dashboard page.

This page reflects the chosen outcome :one: so that you can confirm that you are working on the correct one at the moment.

The next step is to select how you will be evaluating student work on the three Pathways levels: Developing Competency, Competent, and Advanced Competency :two:  Click the toggle next to the one you would like to activate :three:.

When you have activated the desired method, click the **Continue** button :four: at the bottom of the page.

Below is a reminder of the options available.  Click a link to go directly to a detailed page describing the setup process for each option.  You can also use the menu at left to jump between them, as well.

1. ["Thresholds Based on Point Totals"](option1.md)
    - Based on final point total of entire assignment/quiz
    - An overall assignment grade may only be used to measure a Pathways Outcome if every aspect of the assignment directly relates to that outcome and no other Pathways outcomes/skills/knowledge areas.
2. ["New Quiz Thresholds Based on Selected Quiz Questions"](option2.md)
    - Based on Pathways outcomes applied to quiz questions
    - Based on number of points on questions for an outcome (at least 3 per outcome per quiz)
    - Quiz must be built with corresponding outcomes
3. ["Thresholds Based on Selected Quiz/Exam Questions"](option3.md)
    - Choose a "Classic" quiz. 
    - Select the specific questions, question banks, or groups that are relevant to this Pathways Outcome and then set the threshold of points required to meet each competency level.
    - Uses final point total on selected questions. Competencies calculated automatically.
    - There must be at least one submission of the particular quiz before configuring this option
4. ["Use an Existing Grading Rubric"](option4.md)
    - Use point totals for selected rubric items to apply a Pathways rating for an outcome
    - Can use the same assignment for multiple Pathways outcomes
    - Outcomes will be visible to students if you use Pathways-specific rubric items
5. ["Hiding Assessment from Students for a Single Pathways Outcome"](option5.md)
    - Students won't see ratings for Pathways Outcomes in the gradebook.
    - With this method, the same assignment can be used to assess multiple Pathways Outcomes.
    - Requires separate grading in a specialized tool. Course grading and Pathways assessment are separate processes.
