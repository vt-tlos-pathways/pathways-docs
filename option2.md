# Configuring Outcome Mapping Option #2

> **"New Quiz Thresholds Based on Selected Quiz Questions"**

?> :white_check_mark: Based on Pathways outcomes applied to quiz questions  
:white_check_mark: With this method, the same assignment can be used to assess multiple Pathways Outcomes  
:white_check_mark: Based on number of points on questions for an outcome (at least 3 questions per outcome per quiz)  
:white_check_mark: Quiz must be built with corresponding outcomes  
:white_check_mark: Outcomes must be configured ***before any student submissions exist***

Option #2 is used if you want to assess a quiz using ***multiple*** Pathways learning outcomes.  If you are only assessing a ***single*** outcome for an entire quiz, please consider using Option #1 instead.

To use Option #2, your quiz must have been created using **New Quizzes** in Canvas. If you have not consciously chosen "New Quiz" when creating a quiz, then your quiz is a **Classic** quiz.

!> Creating a New Quiz is beyond the scope of this document. First, please review [TLOS's information regarding how New Quizzes may impact your course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x9UzmXJjRu_THnXA6l759l9qiaO8AOLDi_nD6y9u6fY/edit#heading=h.424hqqt677wu). Before creating a New Quiz, you will need to follow that document's instructions for turning on New Quizzes in your course site.  
For further help, see ["How do I create a quiz using New Quizzes"](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-create-a-quiz-using-New-Quizzes/ta-p/1173) from the Canvas community site or contact TLOS.   
You can also convert a Classic quiz to a New quiz by [following these instructions from Stanford](https://canvashelp.stanford.edu/hc/en-us/articles/4405026108179-Enable-and-Use-New-Quizzes#h_01HPJ2MZZSH23BTJDDXYYXY5G7).  You will receive an email when the conversion is complete.

## Setting Up a New Quiz

Once you have created a New quiz, return to the **Build** screen for the quiz you want to assess.

![Quiz Builder](/_media/quizbuilder.png "Quiz Builder")

Edit a question to which you want to apply a Pathways outcome by clicking anywhere on it or by clicking on the pencil icon for it.

Click on the heading for that question's **Align to Outcomes(0)** option to expand it.

![Align to Outcomes option](/_media/aligntooutcomes.png "Align to Outcomes option")

Click on the clipboard to open a new window where you can choose an outcome to apply.

In the new "Attached Outcomes" window, click on **Pathways Assessment Outcomes** :one: then click on the Pathways concept that has the outcome you want to apply. :two:

Click the checkbox next to the Pathways outcome you want to apply. :three: (n.b. Do ***not*** click the link for the outcome.)

Click the **Confirm Alignments** button to confirm. :four:

![Attached Outcomes Guide](/_media/attachedoutcomes.png "Attached Outcomes Guide")

Repeat these steps for other questions in the quiz.  You can assign as many different outcomes to the same quiz as you need.

!> ***IMPORTANT NOTES***  
:eight_pointed_black_star: You **must** assign the same outcome to ***at least*** three (3) questions in each quiz to use Option #2.  
:eight_pointed_black_star: A quiz question should only have one outcome assigned to it.

## Selecting a New Quiz

The select assignment page displays a list of all of your assignments.  If a quiz is available, it will have a green **"Select"** button to its right. :one:

If you have more than ten (10) assignments in your course, then the assignments will be broken into multiple pages that can be scrolled through at the bottom of the list. :two:

Clicking the name of an assignment will open that Canvas assignment in a new browser tab. :three:

In the list, you are reminded of the points that each assignment is worth :four: and the state of the assignment in Canvas: published (available to students) or unpublished (unavailable to students). :five:

To help you match a valid New quiz to the outcome you're currently working on, the list of assignments also displays the Pathways outcomes that have been assigned to questions in each New quiz. :six: If there are no outcomes associated with the New quiz you want to use, you can click on the name of the quiz to add them now. You may only select one quiz per Pathways learning outcome.

Click the **Select** button for the desired New quiz when you're ready to attach it to the outcome.

## Confirming Attachment

### Quiz is Configured

If a quiz already has at least three (3) questions with the current outcome associated with it, you will see the following message:

![New Quiz Ready](/_media/newquizready.png "New Quiz Ready")

Click the **Confirm and Save** button then click anywhere on the screen when the confirmation box appears.

### Quiz is NOT Configured

If a quiz does **NOT** have the current outcome associated with it ***OR*** it does not have at least three (3) questions associated, you will see the following screen:

![New Quiz Not Ready](/_media/quiznotready.png "New Quiz Not Ready")

Here, the **Confirm and Save** button is deactivated, and the message reflects that the quiz is not properly set up.

From this screen, you can click on the name of the quiz to open it in a new browser tab.  Then you will be able to add the outcome to questions [as demonstrated above](#setting-up-a-new-quiz).

After you have added the outcome to at least three questions, return to this page and click the **refresh** link in the message. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the message from the **Quiz is Configured** section above.

## Finalizing Option #2

!> ***IMPORTANT NOTE***  
Your quiz must already have been taken by students, **AND** you must grade any questions that are not auto-graded before continuing.

From the Dashboard screen, click the **Finalize Outcomes** button next to the New Quiz configured with Option #2.

![Begin finalizing option 2](/_media/finalizeoption2.png "Begin finalizing option 2")

The finalize screen will display a set of sliders based on the total points for the questions ***for which this particular outcome has been assigned***. 

In the sample quiz shown below, the quiz has five (5) questions assigned to the outcome being assessed. This is reflected by the sliders allowing no more than 5 points in the thresholds to be assigned to the Pathways ratings. The sliders will always move in concert with one another to guarantee that all three levels always are accounted for.  Minimums are *inclusive* of the number shown.  The left slider sets the minimum score for **Competent**.  The right slider sets the minimum score for **Advanced Competency**.  The three levels are then indicated by the bar below.

Move the sliders to your desired values for each rating.

When you are satisfied with the levels, click the **Confirm &amp; Submit** button. You will receive a confirmation pop-up box. Click anywhere on the screen to return to the Dashboard page.

!> Remember that your students must take the quiz and it must be graded ***PRIOR TO*** finalizing the Pathways outcome for Option #2.  If not, you will receive the following warning message and all students will be counted as "No Evidence".
