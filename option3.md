# Configuring Outcome Mapping Option #3

> **"Thresholds Based on Selected Quiz/Exam Questions"**

?> :white_check_mark: Choose a "Classic" quiz.  
:white_check_mark:  Select the specific questions, question banks, or groups that are relevant to this Pathways Outcome and then set the threshold of points required to meet each competency level.  
:white_check_mark:  Uses final point total on selected questions. Competencies calculated automatically.  
:white_check_mark:  There must be at least one submission of the particular quiz before configuring this option

Option #3 is used if you want to assess a quiz using ***multiple*** Pathways learning outcomes.  If you are only assessing a ***single*** outcome for an entire quiz, please consider using Option #1 instead.

To use Option #3, your quiz must have been created using **Classic Quizzes** in Canvas.

## Selecting a Classic Quiz

The select assignment page displays a list of Classic quizzes that are valid for Option #3.  If a quiz is available it will have a green **"Select"** button to its right. :one:

If you have more than ten (10) assignments eligible, then the assignments will be broken into multiple pages that can be scrolled through at the bottom of the list. :two:

Clicking the name of an assignment will open that Canvas assignment in a new browser tab. :three:

In the list, you are reminded of the points that each assignment is worth :four: and the state of the assignment in Canvas: published (available to students) or unpublished (unavailable to students). :five:

Click the **Select** button for the desired Classic quiz when you're ready to attach it to the outcome.

## Confirming Attachment

Based on whether or not a student has taken the quiz at this point, you will encounter one of the two following scenarios.

### Quiz is NOT Ready to be Configured

If a Classic quiz has **NOT** has not been taken by any student (real or test), you will see the following message:

![Classic Quiz Not Ready](/_media/classicquiznotready.png "Classic Quiz Not Ready")

Here, the **Confirm and Save** button is deactivated, and the message reflects that the quiz has no submissions.

From this screen, you can click on the name of the quiz to open it in a new browser tab.  Then you will be able to take the quiz as a test student by clicking the "View as Student" button in the top-right corner of the screen.

![View as Student Button](/_media/viewasstudentbutton.png "View as Student Button")

The test student's submission will not be seen in your gradebook and will otherwise have no other impact on your course.

Once completed, click the "Go Back" button in the Pathways Tool, and select the quiz again [as shown above](#selecting-a-classic-quiz).

### Quiz is Ready to be Configured

If a quiz has been taken by at least one student (real or test), you will see a list of your quiz's questions ***similar*** to the following image:

![Classic Quiz Ready](/_media/classicquiztaken.png "Classic Quiz Ready")

In this example, there are five questions in this quiz.  Click the checkbox next to each question that you would like to include in the rating for the currently selected Pathways outcome :one:.

!> ***IMPORTANT NOTE***  
The total of the questions you select should ***at least*** be three (3) points to allow proper distribution of the three Pathways rating levels.

Once questions are selected, you are able to set the threshold scores for the three Pathways levels that are based on the total points of the selected questions.

The sliders reflect the total points, and will always move in concert with one another to guarantee that all three levels always are accounted for.  Minimums are *inclusive* of the number shown.  The left slider :two: sets the minimum score for **Competent**.  The right slider :three: sets the minimum score for **Advanced Competency**.  The three levels are then indicated by the bar below.

Click the **Confirm and Save** button :four: then click anywhere on the screen when the confirmation box appears.

## Finalizing Option #3

!> ***IMPORTANT NOTE***  
You must grade any questions that are not auto-graded before continuing.

From the Dashboard screen, click the **Finalize Outcomes** button next to the Classic Quiz configured with Option #3.

![Begin finalizing option 3](/_media/finalizeoption3new.png "Begin finalizing option 3")

The Pathways tool will automatically read the grades for your quiz and apply the threshold levels set previously.

The finalize screen will display the selected questions from this quiz that apply to the current Pathways outcome along with a review of the thresholds you set for the Pathways rating levels.

Double-check both that your threshold levels are set correctly and that the distribution of scores matches your perception of the quality of student work submitted. If students have not completed the quiz or you have not graded those students' quizzes, they will be categorized under "No Evidence".

![Option 3 Finalize Screen](/_media/option3newfinalizescreen.png "Option 3 Finalize Screen")

If the data are correct, click the **Confirm & Submit** button then click anywhere on the screen to return to the dashboard.

The assignment will then appear as **Complete**.  If you have completed this process too soon (e.g., more assignments need to be graded, accidentally clicked Confirm, etc.), click the **Undo Finalization** button.
