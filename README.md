# Pathways Assessment Reporting Tool

!> *This documentation is accurate as of January 5, 2026*.

## Summary

The **Pathways Assessment Reporting Tool** is a Canvas-based application for preparing your course to report student performance on Pathways student learning outcomes.

## Project Goals

- Reduce semester-end reporting burden on faculty
- Increase completed reporting submission rate

## Requirements and Assumptions

- Course must use Canvas for assignments and grading
  - Course does not *need* to be publicly available to students
- Pathways concepts and outcomes are pre-loaded in courses in Canvas so you'll only see those that apply to your course

- Faculty then apply outcomes to assignments using the tool

- Assessed assignments must use ***built-in*** Canvas tools

  :white_check_mark: Assignments, Quizzes, Discussions, External LTI tools that address a ***single*** Pathways outcome  
  :no_entry_sign: External LTI tools through which multiple Pathways outcomes are evaluated
- Assessed assignments must be configured in the app prior to reporting
  - Can be done at any time during the semester
  - Can be done retroactively even if assignment is in the past
- Each configuration option below can be used more than once
  - For example, the same option can be used for all outcomes, if desired
- For Option 1:
  - Assignment must completely address the chosen outcome
  - Assignment cannot be used for any other outcome
- For Options 2-5:
  - The same assignment can address multiple outcomes
  - Different elements of the assignment must be used for different outcomes
  - Different rubric items or different quiz questions


## Outcome Mapping Options
 
Below are the options available for mapping an assignment to an outcome. They will be described in greater detail on subsequent pages.

1. "Thresholds Based on Point Totals"
    - Based on final point total of entire assignment/quiz
    - An overall assignment grade may only be used to measure a Pathways Outcome if every aspect of the assignment directly relates to that outcome and no other Pathways outcomes/skills/knowledge areas.
2. "New Quiz Thresholds Based on Selected Quiz Questions"
    - Based on Pathways outcomes applied to "New" Quiz questions
    - Based on number of points on questions for an outcome (at least 3 per outcome per quiz)
    - Quiz must be built with corresponding outcomes ***before any student submissions exist***
3. "Thresholds Based on Selected Quiz/Exam Questions"
    - Choose a "Classic" quiz. 
    - Select the specific questions, question banks, or groups that are relevant to this Pathways Outcome and then set the threshold of points required to meet each competency level.
    - Uses final point total on selected questions. Competencies calculated automatically.
    - There must be at least one submission of the particular quiz before configuring this option
4. "Use an Existing Grading Rubric"
    - Use point totals for selected rubric items to apply a Pathways rating for an outcome
    - Can use the same assignment for multiple Pathways outcomes
    - Outcomes will be visible to students if you use Pathways-specific rubric items
5. "Hiding Assessment from Students for a Single Pathways Outcome"
    - Students won't see ratings for Pathways Outcomes in the gradebook.
    - With this method, the same assignment can be used to assess multiple Pathways Outcomes.
    - Requires separate grading in a specialized tool. Course grading and Pathways assessment are separate processes.

## Caveats for Evaluating Quizzes

Canvas has two types of quizzes available: ***Classic*** and ***New***. Unless you have actively created a ***New*** quiz, your quizzes are ***Classic***.

- If you want to evaluate all questions on a quiz for a single Pathways outcome with ***Classic*** or ***New*** quizzes, use Option #1.
- If you want to evaluate multiple Pathways outcomes in a single ***New*** quiz, use Option #2.
- If you want to evaluate multiple Pathways outcomes in a single ***Classic*** quiz, use Option #3.
- If you want to evaluate multiple questions on a quiz for multiple Pathways outcomes ***separate from grading*** with ***Classic*** or ***New*** quizzes, use Option #5.

!> **Before you create a New quiz or convert a Classic quiz to a New quiz, please be aware of the following:**  
 :x: You cannot transfer multiple question banks from Classic to New Quizzes  
 :x: New quizzes will not work if you have multiple questions with attachments, files, images, or videos including links to Kaltura videos and 3rd party tools  
 :x: New quizzes cannot function if you use a quiz to act like a survey

## Pathways Assessment Tool Workflow

1. Set up your assignments in Canvas
1. Align an assignment with Pathways outcomes in the Tool
1. Grade assignments in SpeedGrader
1. Assess assignments for Pathways in the Tool if using Option #5
1. Finalize Pathways outcomes in the Tool
1. Review outcomes results in the Tool
1. Submit results in the Tool
